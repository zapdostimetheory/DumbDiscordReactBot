# DumbDiscordReactBot
A easily configurable Discord bot to react to messages in your owned/admined servers.

This was done on a whim to see if I could bring a bot online who could react to what my friends said in the chat. We liked to poke fun of each others' console choices, hence the console bashing. I left it in as tribute to my friends. 

Easily configurable, just to need to set up on the server side. Name the program bot.py, turn on the server/service, and the server will receive a message from the bot when it's ready.

You will need the Discord bot API key. 


I wanted to implement a playable version of Wordle into here, but found the interactions limited and to play would be extremely manual, so I abandoned the project and deleted all tests. Maybe one day when I set up another server..
